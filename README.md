DEZABOT
=======

Inspired by @alfredodeza, DEZABOT is an IRC bot that prints GIF URLS that match
predefined phrases in every message. Currently the list of GIFs is hardcoded,
but future versions will be able to query a database or API.

*Caveat:* Only people who's IRC clients render images in line will benefit
          from this. Everyone else will likely get annoyed by all the links.
